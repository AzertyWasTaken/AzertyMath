    <h1>Sequence</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>A sequence is a list of numbers in which repetitions are allowed and order matters.</p>

    <h2>Triangular number</h2>
    <p>The triangular sequence is a sequence where the \(n\)th number is the sum of the first \(n\) positive integers.</p>
    <p>The \(10\) first triangular numbers are \(1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55 \).</p>
    <p>The formula of triangular number is \(n \times (n + 1) \div 2 \).</p>
    <p>\(3\) is the only prime triangular number.</p>

    <h2>Factorial number</h2>
    <p>The factorial sequence is a sequence where the \(n\)th number is the product of the first \(n\) positive integers.</p>
    <p>The \(6\) first factorial numbers are \(1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720 \).</p>
    <p>\(2\) is the only prime factorial number.</p>

    <h2>Square number</h2>
    <p>The square sequence is a sequence where the nth number equal n multiplied by itself.</p>
    <p>The \(10\) first square numbers are \(1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100 \).</p>
    <p>A number is square if and only if it have a odd number of divisors.</p>
    <p>\(36\) is the smallest number that is both square and triangular.</p>

    <h2>Fibonacci sequence</h2>
    <p>The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence in which each number is the sum of the two numbers that precede it, starting with \(1\) and \(1\).</p>
    <p>The \(10\) first numbers are \(1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 \).</p>
