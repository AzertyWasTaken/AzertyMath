    <h1>Division</h1>
    <h2>Definition</h2>
    <p>Division is an operation that involve separating a number into equal parts.</p>
    <p>Division is denoted with the รท symbol.</p>
    <p>Dividing an integer n by another integer that is not divisible by n result in a fraction.</p>
    <p>An integer is divisible by another integer if its division have no remainder.</p>

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>Division is not commutative: changing the order of its numbers may change the result.</p>
    <p>Dividing any number by 1 never change its result.</p>
    <p>Dividing any number (except 0) by itself equal 1.</p>

    <h2>Divisor</h2>
    <p>A divisor of an integer n is an integer that may be multiplied by some integer to produce exactly n.</p>
    <p>The divisor count of the first n numbers are 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2, 4, 3, 4.</p>
    
    <h3>Properties</h3>
    <p>Every integer is divisible by 1 and itself.</p>
    <p>A number have a odd number of divisors if and only if it is square.</p>
    <p>If an integer n is a divisor of an integer m, m / n is also a divisor of m.</p>

    <h2>Modulus</h2>
    <p>Modulus is an operation that associate to two numbers the remainder of their division.</p>
    <p>Modulus is denoted with the % symbol.</p>
